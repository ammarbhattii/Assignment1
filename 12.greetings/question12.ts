// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

for (let i = 0; i < myFriend.length; i++){
    console.log(`Hi,${myFriend[i]} ! have a good Day.`);
